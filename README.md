Grocery Cart Project with JS

So, I have done this project relatively easy. There were some problems here and there but,
nothing too hard.

First thing I did, which kinda suprised me, was looping over Node array thingy, by making an array out of it, 
with spread operator. Also made tracking all those children easy.

Second thing I did, was adding "ontouch" event listener. This was first time I did that, and I am 
still new to this. Especially since there is a lot there to learn. But I am proud of implementing it
either way. I will learn rest of those event listeners eventually.

In next project, I will use localStorage, and I am kinda excited to finally learn how to 
use it.

Onwards to next project!
